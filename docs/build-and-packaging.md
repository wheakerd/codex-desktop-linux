# Build And Packaging

## Prerequisites

You need:

- `python3`, `7z` or `7zz`, `curl`, `unzip`, `tar`, `make`, `g++`
- Rust toolchain with `cargo` for `codex-update-manager`,
  `codex-computer-use-linux`, the Chrome extension host binary, and optional
  Rust-backed features such as Read Aloud MCP and Record & Replay

The installer downloads a managed Linux Node.js runtime into
`codex-app/resources/node-runtime` and uses it for `node`, `npm`, and `npx`
during the build. Existing `nvm`, asdf, Volta, NodeSource, or nodejs.org
installs are fine, but no longer required for the generated app build. The
dependency helper may still install or validate a distro Node.js toolchain on
some bootstrap paths.

Bootstrap dependencies:

```bash
bash scripts/install-deps.sh
```

It detects `apt`, `dnf5`, `dnf`, `pacman`, or `zypper`, installs system
packages, and bootstraps Rust through `rustup` when needed.

## Manual Dependencies

```bash
# Fedora 41+
sudo dnf install python3 7zip curl unzip tar rpm-build make gcc-c++ @development-tools

# Fedora < 41
sudo dnf install python3 p7zip p7zip-plugins curl unzip tar rpm-build make gcc-c++
sudo dnf groupinstall 'Development Tools'

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install python3 p7zip-full curl unzip tar
sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_basis

# Arch / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S --needed python p7zip curl unzip tar zstd base-devel

# Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

On apt-based systems, `scripts/install-deps.sh` can still bootstrap optional
NodeSource Node.js for users who want a system Node.js toolchain:

```bash
bash scripts/install-deps.sh
NODEJS_MAJOR=24 bash scripts/install-deps.sh
```

Ubuntu-family `p7zip-full` can be too old for newer APFS DMGs, so
`install-deps.sh` bootstraps `7zz` into `~/.local/bin` by default.

## Generate The Local App

```bash
make build-app
make build-app-fresh
make build-app DMG=/path/to/Codex.dmg
```

Equivalent direct commands:

```bash
./install.sh
./install.sh /path/to/Codex.dmg
./install.sh --fresh
```

The default path stores upstream DMG headers, plus a hash of the upstream URL,
next to `Codex.dmg` and refreshes the cached file when that upstream fingerprint
changes. Every command builds a sibling candidate and runs the shared
[upstream DMG acceptance profile](upstream-dmg-acceptance.md) before replacing
`codex-app/`. A rejected or inconclusive candidate leaves the working app
unchanged. Acceptance checks only configured Linux Features and rejects drift
in any enabled feature; disable that feature before retrying if necessary.
Replacing an existing app uses an atomic directory exchange plus a recovery
journal, so interruption cannot leave the canonical install path missing. If
the filesystem does not support atomic exchange, promotion stops without
changing the working app.
`--fresh` still forces a cache removal before rebuilding, and an
explicit `DMG=/path/to/Codex.dmg` uses that file exactly.
Native install shortcuts use `--fresh --reuse-dmg`, so they build a clean
candidate while still reusing the cached DMG when upstream metadata matches.

For deterministic test rounds, set `CODEX_DMG_REFRESH_MODE=pinned`. Pinned mode
reuses the existing cached `Codex.dmg` verbatim, skips upstream metadata checks,
and fails instead of downloading when no cached DMG or explicit `DMG=...` path is
available. This also keeps `--fresh` from deleting the cached DMG.

Before accepting a fast-moving upstream DMG, run the report-only intelligence
lane to inventory protected Sky/Chronicle/Skysight/Computer Use/Record & Replay
surfaces:

```bash
make inspect-upstream DMG=/path/to/Codex.dmg
make inspect-upstream-intel-devcontainer
```

The devcontainer intelligence target downloads the current upstream DMG into
`reports/upstream-dmg/downloads/` when `DMG=...` is omitted and automatically
compares it against repo `./Codex.dmg` when that cached baseline exists.
For an already downloaded candidate, pass only that one path:

```bash
make inspect-upstream-intel-devcontainer DMG=/path/to/new/Codex.dmg
```

See `docs/upstream-dmg-intelligence.md` for the protected-surface registry,
JSON/Markdown report outputs, and fixture-based test strategy.

Run the generated app:

```bash
make run-app
./codex-app/start.sh
```

## Running The Generated App

By default, second launches reuse the running app through the Linux warm-start
handoff.

Open an independent app process:

```bash
./codex-app/start.sh --new-instance
```

Configure the port range or make every launch use multi-instance mode:

```bash
CODEX_MULTI_LAUNCH_PORT_RANGE=5175-5199 ./codex-app/start.sh --new-instance
CODEX_MULTI_LAUNCH=1 CODEX_MULTI_LAUNCH_PORT_RANGE=5175-5199 ./codex-app/start.sh
```

`CODEX_MULTI_LAUNCH=1` applies only to that launcher invocation. The launcher
does not forward it into Electron, so a normal launch from an app descendant
does not recursively create another side-by-side instance.

## Package Formats

After `make build-app` or `make build-app-fresh`, build a package from
`codex-app/`:

| Format | Build command | Output | Install |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debian | `make deb` | `dist/codex-desktop_*.deb` | `sudo dpkg -i dist/codex-desktop_*.deb` |
| RPM | `make rpm` | `dist/codex-desktop-*.x86_64.rpm` | `sudo dnf install dist/codex-desktop-*.rpm` or `sudo zypper install dist/codex-desktop-*.rpm` |
| Arch | `make pacman` | `dist/codex-desktop-*.pkg.tar.zst` | `sudo pacman -U dist/codex-desktop-*.pkg.tar.zst` |
| AppImage | `make appimage` | `dist/codex-desktop-*.AppImage` | Run directly |
| Auto-detect | `make package && make install` | matches host distro | handled by `make install` |

Override package version:

```bash
PACKAGE_VERSION=2026.03.24.220723+88f07cd3 make deb
```

The packaging scripts only repackage what is already in `codex-app/`; they do
not download or extract the DMG.

## AppImage Local Self-Build

```bash
make build-app
make appimage
./dist/codex-desktop-*.AppImage
```

The AppImage flow does not include `codex-update-manager`, the systemd user
service, polkit policy, or the native-package update builder.

To make a local AppImage self-contained, install the CLI with its optional
Linux package and pass the package directory to the AppImage build:

```bash
cli_prefix="$HOME/.cache/codex-desktop-linux/appimage-cli"
npm install --prefix "$cli_prefix" --include=optional @openai/codex
CODEX_CLI_BUNDLE_SOURCE="$cli_prefix/node_modules/@openai/codex" make appimage
```

The build copies only `@openai/codex` and the matching Linux architecture
package on x86-64 and ARM64. It does not fetch packages itself. The bundled CLI
is used when `CODEX_CLI_PATH` is unset and takes precedence over a host
installation. This adds the native CLI payload to the AppImage, which is several
hundred MiB for current releases. Rebuild the AppImage when you want to update
the embedded CLI.

When upstream ChatGPT Desktop changes:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
make build-app-fresh
make appimage
```

AppImage builds require `appimagetool` on `PATH`, or:

```bash
APPIMAGETOOL=/path/to/appimagetool make appimage
```

## Electron Mirrors

If runtime downloads from GitHub are slow or blocked:

```bash
ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/ make build-app
```

`ELECTRON_HEADERS_URL` is passed to `@electron/rebuild --dist-url` and must
provide both `node-v<version>-headers.tar.gz` and the matching `SHASUMS256.txt`.

## Build Parallelism

```bash
MAX_BUILD_THREADS=8 make build-app-fresh
MAX_BUILD_THREADS=8 make package
MAX_BUILD_THREADS=8 make install-native
```

`MAX_BUILD_THREADS=0` is the default and preserves each tool's automatic
behavior. A nonzero value controls Cargo jobs, native module rebuild jobs,
Debian package compression, pacman package compression, and RPM zstd payload
compression.

## Make Targets

Run:

```bash
make help
```

Common targets:

```bash
make check
make test
make build-updater
make build-app
make build-app-fresh
make bootstrap-native
