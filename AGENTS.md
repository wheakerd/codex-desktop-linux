# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository adapts the official macOS ChatGPT Desktop DMG into a runnable
Linux app, packages it as `.deb`, `.rpm`, pacman, and AppImage artifacts, and
ships a local Rust update manager that can rebuild future Linux packages from
newer upstream DMGs.

The build flow: `install.sh` downloads/extracts `Codex.dmg`, patches the
extracted app through core and enabled Linux feature descriptors, rebuilds
native modules, downloads Linux Electron, stages bundled resources, writes
`codex-app/start.sh`, and lets package builders produce native artifacts or
AppImage. Native packages also include `codex-update-manager` and an
update-builder bundle.

## Maintainer Rules

- This project supports only the latest upstream `CODEX.DMG`. When fixing
  upstream drift, remove old drift workarounds in the same change. Do not keep
  legacy DMG shapes, fallback patch paths, or version-specific compatibility
  branches around.
- Keep core behavior focused on the app launching and working for most Linux
  users. Experimental, workflow-specific, editor-specific, browser-specific,
  distro-specific, or minority-use integrations belong in `linux-features/` and
  must be disabled by default.
- If an optional feature needs a new core touchpoint, add the smallest generic
  extension point to core, then keep feature-specific logic inside that feature
  directory.
- Do not enable optional features in committed config. `linux-features/features.json`
  is local and gitignored; `features.example.json` stays empty.
- Each repository feature under `linux-features/<id>/` and each local feature
  under `linux-features/local/<id>/` must include a `README.md` next to
  `feature.json`.
- Do not manually patch generated output such as `codex-app/start.sh` for a
  durable fix. Change the source template, build helper, feature, or patch
  descriptor and regenerate.
- Treat updater, package builder, launcher, and feature framework changes as
  cross-format changes unless the code explicitly scopes them to one package
  format or desktop target.

## Source Routing

Use source files, not generated artifacts. Main routing:

- Launcher/webview: `launcher/start.sh.template`, `launcher/webview-server.py`.
- Packaged runtimes: `packaging/linux/codex-packaged-runtime.sh`,
  `packaging/appimage/codex-appimage-runtime.sh`.
- Build pipeline: `scripts/lib/*.sh`.
- Core patches: descriptors in `scripts/patches/core/**/patch.js`,
  implementations in `scripts/patches/impl/`, helpers in `scripts/patches/lib/`.
- Linux features: `linux-features/<id>/`.
- Package builders: `scripts/build-*.sh` and `scripts/lib/package-common.sh`.
- Updater: `updater/src/`.
- Computer Use: `computer-use-linux/`; compositor backends under
  `computer-use-linux/src/windowing/backends/`.
- Nix: `flake.nix`, `flake.lock`, and `nix/`.

## Patch And Feature Rules

- `scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.js` is the build-facing ASAR patcher CLI only.
  Do not import internals from it; use runner/helper APIs.
- Core patch descriptors are the source of truth for shipped Linux
  compatibility patches. Read `scripts/patches/core/README.md` before adding
  or moving descriptors.
- ASAR patches are fail-soft unless intentionally marked `required-upstream`.
  Each patch should be idempotent and report warnings when current upstream
  drift prevents a needle from matching.
- Patch reports are written for installs/rebuilds. Upstream-build CI fails only
  for required upstream patches that are missing or skipped.
- Do not recreate deleted compatibility barrels such as
  `scripts/patches/main-process.js`, `webview-assets.js`, or `shared.js`.
- Feature patching uses only `entrypoints.patchDescriptors`. Removed feature
  patch entrypoints such as `mainBundlePatch` and `entrypoints.patches` are not
  supported.
- Declarative feature `resources`, `runtimeHooks`, and `packageHooks` are
  preferred over ad hoc staging whenever possible.
- Feature resource targets must stay inside the app directory and cannot target
  the app root. Mode values must be quoted octal strings such as `"0644"` or
  `"0755"`.

## Important Runtime Behavior

- DMG extraction can warn when `7z` cannot materialize the `/Applications`
  symlink. This is acceptable if a `.app` bundle was extracted successfully.
- The managed Node.js runtime is installed under
  `codex-app/resources/node-runtime/`. If `CODEX_MANAGED_NODE_VERSION` or
  `CODEX_MANAGED_NODE_URL` is overridden, `CODEX_MANAGED_NODE_SHA256` must be
  set too.
- GUI launchers often do not inherit shell `PATH`. The generated launcher
  searches common Codex CLI and `nvm` locations and respects `CODEX_CLI_PATH`.
- CLI preflight is launcher-scoped and best-effort. It can prompt to install
  or update the Codex CLI, but failures should warn rather than block app
  launch.
- The generated launcher starts the local webview server before Electron and
  verifies the expected startup markers. See
  [webview server evaluation](docs/webview-server-evaluation.md) before
  changing the server model.
- Warm-start handoff uses a Unix-domain socket under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` so
  second launches can send actions to the running app.
- Linux Computer Use plugin registration is default-on platform port glue, but
  Computer Use UI enablement remains opt-in and must not bypass upstream
  server-side rollouts unrelated to local Linux support.
- The Linux Chrome integration patches staged bundled resources. Do not fix
  only the user cache.
- Native package install/removal hooks start, stop, disable, and reload the
  `systemd --user` updater service on a best-effort basis.
- Failed privileged updater installs stay failed until a newer rebuild or an
  explicit retry path; avoid auto-retrying every reconcile cycle.
- Automated user-local updater paths must force acceptance and running-app
  overrides off. They may build alongside a running app, but promotion must
  wait for exit or fail without replacing the installed runtime.
- Transactional app promotion retains only the immediately previous managed
  app backup; older exact managed backups are pruned under the promotion lock.
- Manual rollback uses the last-known-good package recorded in updater state
  and the same format-specific command layer as normal installs.
- Local installs, updater rebuilds, and scheduled CI use the same upstream DMG
  acceptance profile. Build into a sibling candidate and promote it only after
  an `accepted` or `accepted_with_warnings` verdict. Only user-enabled Linux
  features participate in local/updater acceptance, and drift in any enabled
  feature rejects the candidate. Disabled features are not probed. Rejected or
  inconclusive candidates must not replace the working app.
- Existing local apps are promoted with atomic directory exchange and a durable
  recovery journal. Do not reintroduce a two-rename window in which the
  canonical install path is absent, and do not fall back when the filesystem
  lacks atomic exchange support.

## Generated Artifacts

Treat these as generated or local runtime state, not primary source:
`codex-app/`, `codex-app-next/`, `.codex-app.candidate-*`, `codex-*-app/`, `dist/`,
`dist/appimage.AppDir/`, `dist-next/rebuild/`, `target/`, `Codex.dmg`,
`linux-features/features.json`, `linux-features/local/`,
`codex-app/.codex-linux/linux-features-staged.json`, updater config/state/log
files under `~/.config`, `~/.local/state`, and `~/.cache`, launcher state under
`~/.cache/codex-desktop` and `~/.local/state/codex-desktop`, and
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/codex-desktop/launch-action.sock`.

See [generated and runtime notes](docs/agents/generated-and-runtime-notes.md)
for details.

## Common Commands

Regenerate the Linux app: `./install.sh ./Codex.dmg` or `./install.sh`.
Guided native setup/install/update: `make setup-native`,
`make bootstrap-native`, `make install-native`, `make update-native`.

Build native packages:

```bash
./scripts/build-deb.sh
./scripts/build-rpm.sh
./scripts/build-pacman.sh
./scripts/build-appimage.sh
```

Side-by-side rebuild candidate: `./scripts/rebuild-candidate.sh` or
`./scripts/rebuild-candidate.sh --install`.

## Runtime Expectations

- `python3`, `7z`, `curl`, `unzip`, `tar`, `flock`, `make`, and `g++` are required for
  `install.sh`.
- Native package builders require their format-specific tools: `dpkg-deb`,
  `rpmbuild`, `makepkg`/pacman tooling, or `appimagetool`.
- `scripts/install-deps.sh` bootstraps common host dependencies. On apt-based
  systems, `NODEJS_MAJOR=24 bash scripts/install-deps.sh` selects Node.js 24.
- The packaged app still needs the Codex CLI at runtime, but launcher preflight
  attempts a best-effort install/update when possible.

## Validation Matrix

Run the subset that matches the change; see the
[validation playbook](docs/agents/validation-playbook.md) for expanded checks.

```bash
bash -n install.sh
bash -n scripts/lib/*.sh
bash -n launcher/start.sh.template
bash -n scripts/build-deb.sh scripts/build-rpm.sh scripts/build-pacman.sh scripts/build-appimage.sh
node --test scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.test.js
node --test linux-features/*/test.js
bash tests/scripts_smoke.sh
cargo check -p codex-update-manager
cargo test -p codex-update-manager
```

Build the affected package formats when package payloads or shared package
logic changes. Run `./scripts/ci-local.sh pr` or `./scripts/ci-local.sh all`
for broad cross-format confidence.

## Editing Guidance

- Keep native-package-only behavior in `packaging/linux/` helpers and
  AppImage-only behavior in `packaging/appimage/` helpers.
- Keep all package builders aligned through `scripts/lib/package-common.sh`
  when adding or removing shared payload files.
- Keep new core patch descriptors fail-soft and idempotent unless there is a
  deliberate `required-upstream` CI policy.
- Keep optional features disabled by default. When a user enables one, its
  patch drift must block candidate promotion until the user disables it or the
  feature is repaired for the current DMG.
- Add tests near the behavior being changed: patcher tests for ASAR needles,
  feature tests for Linux features, Rust tests for updater/MCP backends, and
  package smoke checks for payload/layout changes.
- When refreshing Nix hashes, use `scripts/ci/update-nix-hashes.sh`; do not
  hand-edit SRI hashes in `flake.nix`.
